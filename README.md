# Me - repository

Welcome to the repository of my website! This repository contains the complete codebase for my website, which you can visit [here](https://me-two-gold.vercel.app/).

Feel free to explore the code and see how everything is put together. There's plenty to discover whether you're interested in the frontend code or overall project structure.

If you have any questions, or suggestions, or just want to connect, you can find me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/tteixeira296).

Happy coding!

#### Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
